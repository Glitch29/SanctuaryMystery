# Locating the first red coin
<details><summary>1</summary>You need to be small to go through a pipe with a conveyor in the top half of it.</details>

<details><summary>3</summary>Screens only scroll up when Mario is standing on a solid object.</details>

# Locating the second red coin
<details><summary>1</summary>There's no way to hide a red coin on the screen. There must be part of this world you haven't explored yet.</details>

<details><summary>2</summary>Where could the unexplored section be? How tall is the main world? How tall is the sub world? How wide is the main world? How wide is the sub world?</details>

<details><summary>3</summary>Three of those four questions can be answered with certainty. One is unknown.</details>

<details><summary>4</summary>There must be something special about the subworld which keeps us from scrolling the screen. What is it?</details>

<details><summary>5</summary>The subworld is an autoscroller. The goal is at the exit to a pipe in the main world.</details>

<details><summary>6</summary>There must be a pipe in the subworld that's just offscreen. How can we get to it?</details>
